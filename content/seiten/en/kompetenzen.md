        text: In close cooperation with machine manufacturers from the region, we
          constantly update our machine park according to the market conditions
          and the latest technological standard in injection molding technology.
          Since August 2011, we have owned fully electric 1K and 2K spray
          systems with 6-axis robots that produce under clean room class 7 and
          also pack according to customer requirements. In total we work with
          nine 2K and seven 1K machines. We mainly process technical
          thermoplastics such as PMMA, POM, but we also regularly use
          high-performance plastics such as PEEK or PPSU. In addition, we also
          manufacture products from special materials such as PUR, TPU or
          silicone elastomer.
