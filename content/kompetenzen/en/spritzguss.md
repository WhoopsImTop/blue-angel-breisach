competenceDescription: In close cooperation with machine manufacturers from the
  region, we constantly update our machine park according to the market
  conditions and the latest technological standard in injection molding
  technology. Since August 2011, we have owned fully electric 1K and 2K spray
  systems with 6-axis robots that produce under clean room class 7 and also pack
  according to customer requirements. In total we work with nine 2K and seven 1K
  machines. We mainly process technical thermoplastics such as PMMA, POM, but we
  also regularly use high-performance plastics such as PEEK or PPSU. In
  addition, we also manufacture products from special materials such as PUR, TPU
  or silicone elastomer.
