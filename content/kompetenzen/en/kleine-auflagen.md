competenceTitle: Ideal start-up partner
competenceDescription: In addition to the series production of plastic parts for
  different branches of industry, we also offer our customers samples, pilot and
  small series. Through the cooperation with various universities from the
  University of Freiburg to the Charit√© Berlin and the resulting projects, we
  dealt early on with the cost-effective production of pilot and small series
  and observed the development of additive manufacturing processes. In the small
  series area, we have had very good experiences with plastic inserts
  manufactured using the 3D process. This enables us to offer a real and
  cost-effective alternative to classic injection molding.
