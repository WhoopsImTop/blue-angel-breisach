competenceTitle: Hybrid and fully electric
competenceDescription: In close cooperation with machine manufacturers from the
  region, we update our machine park according to the market conditions and the
  latest technological standard in injection molding technology. Since August
  2011 we have been in possession of fully electric 2K spraying systems and
  6-axis robots with handling and packaging of the sprayed products under clean
  room conditions. We work with a total of 15 machines, all of which are of
  course state-of-the-art. Thanks to our expertise in 2K technology, we can
  produce everything in one operation. This is cheaper and more efficient and
  also avoids errors. Products that can be used directly can be manufactured in
  large quantities in a very short time.
